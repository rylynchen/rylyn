You can find add more demo in drupal examples module (https://drupal.org/project/examples).

But when I tried to use it in the project, I found it's not enough.

Becouse it always delete the last one. we can't delete a special one.

So I create this demo to show it.

I think this is an advance add more demo.

Hope it can help someone.
